# KITT
"Knowledge-Intensive Transformational Technology."

Introducing the new KITT on the block for all your AI GUI needs. An advanced AI system that focuses on transforming various knowledge-intensive tasks and processes by leveraging deep learning and natural language processing techniques to improve efficiency, accuracy, and overall performance. A powerful AI-driven frontend app built on the Electron framework, designed to give you seamless control over websites without the need for API keys. KITT utilizes a unique WebView feature, enabling full command of any hosted website via JavaScript. For additional flexibility, API key integration is available when required.

KITT currently boasts full support for Dall-E api, GPT api, GPT Edit api, ElevenLabs api, GPT Online, and Google Online, while partial integration includes Open-Assistant Online, Midjourney Discord Online, and YouTube Online. Each WebView benefits from individual Chromium DevTools, streamlining the development process for both Node.js backend and Chromium frontend.

Harness the power of open-source Chromium and experience the unparalleled control offered by KITT for all your web-based projects. With KITT, the possibilities are endless.

Still working on the install manual. The binaries are too large for here and still uploading. 

Nodejs and python3 should be both installed when running from the command prompt with "npm start". 
In case of errors you are on your own for now.
